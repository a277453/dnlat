The customer then chose to cancel the transaction before any cash was dispensed.\n\nWhy it might have happened: It's unclear what prompted the customer to cancel the transaction at this stage, as there is no indication of a problem with the ATM or the customer's account. However, some possible explanations include user error or a change of heart after entering their PIN.\n\nPotential root causes:\n\n* User error: The customer may have decided not to proceed with the transaction for any number of reasons.\n* Insufficient funds: It's also possible that the customer realized they didn't have sufficient funds in their account and chose to cancel the transaction.\n* ATM issue: Although the transaction was cancelled before any cash was dispensed, there could be an underlying issue with the ATM that triggered the cancellation. This might include a problem with the ATM's hardware or software.\n\nNo significant issues detected: The customer successfully entered their PIN, which suggests that the authentication process went smoothly.", "timestamp": "2025-12-09 14:07:41", "submission_date": "2025-12-09", "submission_time": "14:07:41", "session_id": "current_session"}
