# How to Run the Project

This guide provides detailed steps to set up and run the project, including the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Git for cloning the repository.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### c. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can start the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`. Run the following command from the project's root directory, where your `api` folder is located:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The `--reload` flag enables hot-reloading, which automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected.
